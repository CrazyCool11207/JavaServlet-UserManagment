# JavaServlet-UserManagment
JavaServlet Test Project

Hey :D 

My Name is Christian I'am 18 year-old and I just started to learn something about JavaServlet and how to manage diffrent types of projects.JavaServlet is my first selfmade WebProject.So be gentle with me ;) 

This Project here is a WebServlet/JavaServlet with a UserManagment system which is not as cool as the name of the class.

I first created a JavaServlet class in combintaion of a .jsp data where i used HTML code .
How did I do this ? Well I used Maven which created for me a specific type of structure for using WebServlet/JavaServlet which means that Maven created for me some .jsp data one .xml data I think and so on.
<br>Maven code ----> Terminal ------>(if installed) -----> mvn generate:archetype-webapp 
After that I "designed" a little bit my .jsp data for some fancy shit.
Creating a JavaServlet was the next step .<br> But first let me explain to you guys what my project is.
It is a internet site where u can enter your Nickname and your age. That means there are 2 textfields and 1 button for submit.
After the submission you can play for example  BlackJack (work in progress :D).
So there is a UserManagment ;) which is controlling how many people are there ? Are there already Players with the same nickname and so on. That should be the Project.
By the way I am also using Tomcat for a Server and I use Idea IntelliJ Community Edition( because it looks great :D ).




Your sincerely,

Christian :D
